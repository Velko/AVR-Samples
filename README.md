AVR Samples
===========

This is a collection of simple demo projects using AVR microcontrollers.
The purpose is to provide a simple firmware, that can be flashed to check
if the hardware is working as expected and to serve as a source of 
code-snippets for larger projects.

The projects are implemented with no dependencies from eachother. Also the
only external dependency is on [AVR Libc][avr-libc].
